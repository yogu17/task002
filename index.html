<h2>Difference between document and window: </h2>
<Pre> 
                Document                                                                                                                WINDOW

It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser                                     It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.                
                                                   

    
It is loaded inside the window                                                                                   It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

It is the object of window property.                                                                              It is the object of the browser.

All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document                                         Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.


We can access the document from a window using the window. document                                            We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window


The window is part of BOM, not DOM.                                                                             The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)


Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
                                                                                     Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
